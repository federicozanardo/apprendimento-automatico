In this notebook I used a clustering algorithm to create Spotify playlists. 
In particular I used the K-Means partition algothym. 
For a more complete explanation about the clustering algorithms and the K-Means algorithm you can refer to the following [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Eje2F3pvMOL8ukVKtIoeVaDPaKILfEjV).

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features).
