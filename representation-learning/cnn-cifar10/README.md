A **convolutional neural network** (**CNN**) is a type of *feed-forward* artificial neural network. These types of networks are variations of multilayer perceptrons designed to minimize the preprocessing step.

The idea behind a convolutional neural network is to apply a filter to the images before they are processed by the **deep neural network**.

A **convolution** is a filter that is applied to an image, processes it and extracts features with common characteristics. 
The application of the filter therefore allows to highlight the details of the images in such a way that it is possible to derive their meaning and identify the objects. Specifically, a filter consists of a set of multipliers.

In this project I built a first version of a CNN. The second version is an optimization of the first.
