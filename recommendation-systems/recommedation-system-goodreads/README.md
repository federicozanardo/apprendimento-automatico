The purpose of this project is to build a recommendation system for a book rating dataset. 
In particular, the aim is to predict the suggestions about books. 
For this project, I used the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) library. This library is based on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), in fact it is very easy to use the library if you already know scikit.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k).
