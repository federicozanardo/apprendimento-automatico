In this project an implementation of the Perceptron is shown. Different models are created, with different *learning rate* and *number of iterations*. In order to determine which model is the best among those presented, 
*evaluations* are carried out on each model generated.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided by [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html).
