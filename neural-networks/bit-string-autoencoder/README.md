The purpose of this project is to create a multilayer neural network that takes as input a series of binary strings, consisting of 8 bits each, and must return the same values received in input.
The aim is to observe how the input values are represented in the hidden layers of the neural network. It is of particular interest because the hidden layers of the network have fewer nodes, so the network must find an effective representation to fulfill the purpose described.
