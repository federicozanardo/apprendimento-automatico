[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Klbrz2y_BeO8HnElRD0IdKDTBi8I-gg)

The purpose of this project is to create a Stacking classifier for NIST dataset. I used *DecisionTree*, *K-Nearest Neighbors* and a *neural network* (*MLPClassifier*) as **weak learners** and a *LogisticRegression* as a **meta-model**.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits).
